The CSS classes for each UI component that provides the Product Details dropin with its UI are provided here. Override these classes and add new classes to customize the look and feel of your PDP dropin to match your specific style requirements.

:::tip[Boilerplate CSS Tip!]
The Product Details dropin (like most others) contains several components that provide the dropin's UI. As such, if you plan to make more than a few CSS changes to the dropin, we suggest you create a CSS file for each dropin component (in the same directory as the `product-details.css`) and import those files into the `product-details.css` file, which is automatically loaded along with the dropin block. Example:

```css title="product-details.css"
@import 'carousel.css';
@import 'gallery-grid.css';
@import 'overlay.css';
@import 'price-range.css';
@import 'product.css';
@import 'swatches.css';
```

This practice makes it easier to maintain and update your CSS in the future.

## Customizing your PDP styles

The quickest way to override Product Details CSS is to inspect the PDP UI from your browser's developer tools.

</Diagram>

1. **Inspect the element** in the UI that you want to customize (right-click on the element and select "Inspect" from the menu).
1. **Identify the CSS class(es)** for the element. We use [BEM naming](https://getbem.com/naming/), which makes it easy to know which component you're changing (and which CSS file to use). This class styles the `Product` component, so use your `product.css` file.
1. **Copy the CSS class** and add it to your `product.css` file to override the existing rules or add new rules. But wait! Look closely üßê at the `.pdp-product__title` class. It's using two design tokens discussed in the [Brand](/developer/commerce/storefront/customize/brand/) topic for Customizing your dropins. When you see tokens defined for the class rules you want to change, change the token's value instead.

## Example CSS overrides

Here's an example of how to override or add CSS for the Product component (in your `product.css` file):

```css title="product.css" {"Overrides for existing Product styles":2}
/* stylelint-disable no-empty-source */

.pdp-product__options {
  grid-column: 1 / span 3;
}

.pdp-product__quantity {
  grid-column: 1 / span 3;
}

.pdp-product__buttons {
  grid-gap: 0.5rem;
}
```
