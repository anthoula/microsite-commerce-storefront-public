CSS classes! We applied some branding in the previous lesson. Now let's make some deeper changes with CSS classes.

## Concepts

Include the concepts (vocabulary) to understand before proceeding to the details that follow.

## Diagrams

Include diagrams to explain the key concepts and workflow.

## Examples

Include annotated code examples to get specific.

## Step-by-Step

Include explicit steps for those who are doing this for the first time. This is especially important for complex or multi-step processes.

## Playground

Include an embedded sandbox to provide the hands-on practice that makes the steps stick.
