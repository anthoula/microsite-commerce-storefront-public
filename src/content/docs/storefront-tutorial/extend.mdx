This is a huge topic that I'll be finishing this week. It's one of our key differentiators so I want to make sure it's well done.

## slots

A dropin is a microapp that's like a lego brick with studs on all six sides. We call these sides "slots." A slot is an area (one side of the brick) that provides a surface to add more bricks to the dropin brick. This makes it easy for builders (developers) to "customize" that dropin brick by adding their own bricks. And those bricks will bring their own features (UI components, CSS styles, functions) to extend the original dropin brick.

## Concepts

Include the concepts (vocabulary) to understand before proceeding to the details that follow.

## Diagrams

Include diagrams to explain the key concepts and workflow.

## Examples

Include annotated code examples to get specific.

## Step-by-Step

Include explicit steps for those who are doing this for the first time.

## Playground

Include an embedded sandbox to provide the hands-on practice that makes the steps stick.
