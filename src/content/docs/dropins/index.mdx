Dropin components (with Commerce services) make up the entire storefront experience. They are equivalent to small apps that you can mix and match to create a storefront that fits your needs.

## What are dropins?

Dropins are full-featured shopping components. They are not primitive components like Carousels and Galleries. Dropins _define_ the storefront shopping experience. Our dropins include Product Details, Carts, Checkout, User Authentication, User Accounts, with more on the way. This section introduces these dropins and provides links to their details.

### Product Details dropin

The [Product Details](/dropins/product-details/) dropin is designed to render detailed information about products and services, including SKUs, pricing, descriptions, and customizable options, with built-in support for internationalization and accessibility. This dropin is a key component of the e-commerce experience, providing users with essential product details and enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions.

### Cart dropin <Badge text="In Development" variant="danger" size="large" />

The [Cart](/dropins/cart/) dropin provides a summary of the items that the user has added to their
cart. It allows users to view and manage their cart contents, update quantities, and proceed to
checkout. The Cart dropin is a critical component of the e-commerce experience, providing users with
a convenient way to review and adjust their selections before completing their purchase.

### Checkout dropin <Badge text="In Development" variant="danger" size="large" />

The [Checkout](/dropins/checkout/) dropin is a key component of the e-commerce experience, providing users with a streamlined process for completing their purchase. It allows users to enter shipping and payment information, review their order details, and confirm their purchase.

### User Account dropin <Badge text="In Development" variant="danger" size="large" />

The [User Account](/dropins/user-account/) dropin provides users with a personalized experience, allowing them to view their order history, manage their account settings, and access other account-related features.

### User Authentication dropin <Badge text="In Development" variant="danger" size="large" />

The [User Authentication](/dropins/user-auth/) dropin provides users with a secure and seamless way to log in or create an account on your e-commerce platform. It supports various authentication methods, including email, social media, and single sign-on (SSO), ensuring a smooth user experience across devices and platforms.


## How can I customize dropins?

All dropins can be customized in five ways: design tokens, CSS classes, slots, content enrichment, and localization. In this section, you'll learn how to use each approach.

### Design tokens

[Design tokens](/customize/design-tokens/) are the quickest way to customize your storefront. By changing the default token values with your own brand colors, typography, spacing, and shapes, you can make quick, global brand changes to your entire storefront.

### CSS classes

[CSS classes](/customize/style/) provide deeper style changes for dropins than design tokens. Overriding or adding new CSS classes allows you to restyle specific areas of the dropin You'll find best practices for styling here.

### Slots

[Slots](/customize/slots/) provide the deepest level of customization. Slots are built-in extension points in the dropin to add your own UI components and functions. You'll learn how powerful slots can be.

### Content enrichment

[Content enrichment](/customize/enrich/) is similar to adding content with slots. The difference is in scale. Enrichment is an Edge Delivery feature that allows you to add content to entire product categories.

### Localization

[Localization](/customize/localize/) is one of the easiest ways to customize dropins for a region. This topic shows you how to add and use a second language file in your dropins.
