The CSS classes for each UI component that provides the DROPIN_NAME dropin with its UI are provided here. Override these classes and add new classes to customize the look and feel of your PDP dropin to match your specific style requirements.

```css title="DROPIN_NAME.css"
@import 'carousel.css';
@import 'gallery-grid.css';
@import 'overlay.css';
@import 'price-range.css';
@import 'product.css';
@import 'swatches.css';
```

## Customizing your DROPIN_NAME styles

The quickest way to override DROPIN_NAME CSS is to inspect the DROPIN_NAME UI from your browser's developer tools.

1. **Inspect the element** in the UI that you want to customize (right-click on the element and select "Inspect" from the menu).
1. **Identify the CSS class(es)** for the element. We use [BEM naming](https://getbem.com/naming/), which makes it easy to know which component you're changing (and which CSS file to use).
1. **Copy the CSS class** to your `COMPONENT_NAME.css` file to override the existing rules or add new rules to the class.

_Etc. for each component CSS file._

## Summary

You can customize the COMPONENT_NAME dropin by overriding the CSS classes provided for each component. Create a CSS file for each component to make it easier to maintain and update your DROPIN_NAME CSS. Use the BEM naming convention and your browser's dev tools to identify and copy the class to your corresponding component CSS file and override it as needed.
