An Edge Delivery Services storefront is built with components we call blocks. There are two types of blocks: content blocks and commerce blocks. Content blocks are UI components like buttons, carousels, accordions, tabs, and more. See [Boilerplate and Block Collection](https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection#boilerplate) for a complete list. Commerce blocks are Commerce dropins (and Commerce services) that have been integrated into the Edge Delivery Services boilerplate.
