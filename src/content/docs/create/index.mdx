<Aside type="choose" title="**Choose One">
  Choose between **Google Drive** and **SharePoint OneDrive**. By default, the Commerce boilerplate
  uses SharePoint, but you can use Google Drive if you prefer. This tutorial provides instructions
  for both.
</Aside>

## Big picture

From repo to render, this tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a new Edge Delivery Services storefront using our Commerce boilerplate template and starter content. The process involves the following steps:

<Diagram caption="Steps to create your Edge Delivery Services storefront.">
  ![Steps to create your Edge Delivery Services storefront](@images/create/createStorefront.svg)
</Diagram>

<Callouts>

1. **Use the boilerplate** template to create a storefront repository.
1. **Add the Code Sync app** to your newly created repo. This app automatically redeploys your storefront when you push changes to the main branch. It also provides the Edge Delivery system (Helix Admin) with access to your repo so it can coordinate code changes with content changes.
1. **Create a folder** on Google Drive or SharePoint for your content and _Share_ it with the `helix@adobe.com` user. This gives the Edge Delivery system (Helix Admin) with read/write access to your folder's content.
1. **Add sample content** from the boilerplate to your new folder on Google Drive or SharePoint.
1. **Connect your repo to your content** using the mountpoint in your **fstab.yaml** URL in your GitHub repo.
1. **Install and configure Sidekick** so it can preview, publish, and edit content on your storefront.
1. **Set up your local development environment** and install the dependencies. Start the development server and explore your new storefront.

</Callouts>

## Step-by-step

The star of this **20-minute storefront** is our Commerce boilerplate template. It provides a fully-functional storefront that is pre-configured with our Commerce components and services and pre-connected to our Commerce boilerplate backend. Start your timers. Let's go!

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create your storefront repo

<Diagram caption="Create your storefront repo.">
  ![Create your storefront repo](@images/create/create-repo.webp)
</Diagram>

<Callouts>

1. Navigate to [aem-boilerplate-commerce](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce).
1. Select **Use this template**, then **Create a new repository**.
1. **Do not** include all branches. Leave it unchecked to copy content from the main branch only.
1. (_Required_) Choose an **Owner** and **Repository name**.
1. (_Optional_) Create a brief **Description** or not. You can always add or change it later.
1. Set the repo as **Public** or **Private** (we recommend public).
1. Select the **Create repository** button and watch GitHub create your new storefront repo.
1. After a few seconds, you should be redirected to the home page of your new repo.

</Callouts>

</Step>

<Step>

### Add the Code Sync app

When added to your repo, this app redeploys your storefront site whenever you push or merge changes to the `main` branch of your repo. The app keeps your storefront up-to-date with your code changes. And it provides the Edge Delivery infrastructure (Helix Admin) with access to your repo so that it can coordinate code changes with the content changes from Google Drive or SharePoint. More details later. Let's add the app now.

1. Navigate to the [AEM Code Sync app](https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync) and select the **Configure** button at the top right.
1. Select the organization or owner for where you added your new repo.
1. Find the **Repository access** section and choose **Only select repositories**, then select your repo from the menu, and click **Save**.

   <Diagram caption="Add AEM Code Sync to your repository.">
     ![Add AEM Code Sync to your repository.](@images/create/repository-access.webp)
   </Diagram>

1. You'll get a success screen if the installation completed without errors. Close the page and proceed to the next step.

</Step>

<Step>

### Create and share content folder

Now let's create and set up the content side of your storefront. We'll create a new folder and share it with Edge Delivery Services (Helix Admin). Choose the tab that matches your chosen storage service (Google Drive or SharePoint).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Google Drive">

    Follow these steps to create and share your **Google Drive folder**.

    <Diagram caption="Create and Share your Google Drive folder.">
      ![Create and Share your Google Drive content folder.](@images/create/add-share-gd-folder.webp)
    </Diagram>

    <Callouts>

      1. Open your Google Drive [My Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive) page, select the ✚ **New** button (top-left), create a new folder, and give it a name that identifies your storefront.
      1. Select the folder and click the **Share** button.
      1. Type **helix** and select `helix@adobe.com` as the recipient.
      1. Select the **Editor** option provide read/write access to your folder.
      1. **Send** the invitation to give Edge Delivery Services (Helix Admin) read/write access to your content.
      1. Verify the folder was shared correctly by opening the folder and checking for a new Shared icon (👥) to the right of your folder.
      1. Select the icon and verify that `helix@adobe.com` is listed as an editor. Proceed to the next step.

    </Callouts>

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="SharePoint">

    Follow these steps to create and share your **SharePoint folder**.

    <Aside type="note" title="Site templates don't matter">
      During the process of creating your storefront folder on SharePoint, you must first setup a SharePoint Site. We don't use SharePoint Sites in Edge Delivery storefronts, so in step 3 below, you can select any template you want. It won't affect your storefront. We just need to create our folder in a site's **Documents** section.
    </Aside>

    <Diagram caption="Create and Share your SharePoint folder.">
      ![Create and Share your SharePoint Site folder.](@images/create/add-share-sp-folder.webp)
    </Diagram>

    <Callouts>

    1. Open your [SharePoint Home](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Home.aspx) page, select the ![create button](@images/create/create-button.svg) **Create** button, then select **Site** from the menu.
    1. Select the **Communication site**. You can choose the **Team site** if you prefer, but it's harder to set up.
    1. Select a site template, **Standard communication** is the simplest, then select **Use template**. Follow the additional instructions: Give your site a name, click **Next**, sensitivity is always private, default language is English, select **Create site**. When the site is created, you will be redirected to the Home page of your site.
    1. Select the **Documents** tab from your Home page.
    1. Create a new folder and give it a name that identifies your storefront.
    1. Open the folder and select the **Share** button.
    1. Type **helix** and select **AEM Content Integration** from the list.
    1. Select **Can edit** to provide read/write access to your folder.
    1. **Send** the invitation to give Edge Delivery Services (Helix Admin) read/write access to your folder. Proceed to the next step.

    </Callouts>

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

By sharing read/write access to `helix@adobe.com`, you are enabling Edge Delivery (Helix Admin) to provide all the features of document-based authoring, such as editing, previewing, and publishing from Google Drive or SharePoint. Our next step is to add boilerplate sample content to this folder.

</Step>

<Step>

### Add sample content

These instructions differ depending on whether you're using Google Drive or SharePoint. Choose the tab that matches your setup.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Google Drive">
    <Aside type="tip" title="Google Drive auto-conversions">
      The "secret" to converting Word and Excel sample files to Google Docs and Sheets is to enable Uploads in Google Drive's settings. Here's how.
    </Aside>

    <Diagram caption="Add sample Google Drive content.">
      ![Add sample Google Drive content.](@images/create/add-gd-content.webp)
    </Diagram>

    <Callouts>
    1. Open your shared Google Drive folder.
    1. Select the ⚙️ Settings icon and choose the **Settings** menu option.
    1. Enable the **Uploads** checkbox to convert uploads to Google Docs editor format. Now you can return to your storefront folder and drag the boilerplate's Word and Excel files into your folder, as described next.
    1. Go to the boilerplate's [Starter Content](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/releases/tag/starter-content) page and download the `starter-content-commerce.zip` file.
    1. Unzip the file and drag the contents into your folder. This will convert the Word and Excel files to Google Docs and Sheets. Proceed to the next step.
    </Callouts>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="SharePoint">

    <Aside title="SharePoint content">
      With SharePoint, you can either copy the boilerplate files and folders from the <a href="https://adobe.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/HelixProjects/Shared%20Documents/sites/starter-content-commerce" target="_blank">starter-content-commerce</a> folder or download the [starter-content-commerce.zip](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/releases/download/starter-content/starter-content-commerce.zip) from the boilerplate repo and drag the content into your folder. Both content sources are the same, so the choice is yours. But this step shows how to copy the content from the `starter-content-commerce` folder.
    </Aside>

    <Diagram caption="Add sample SharePoint content.">
      ![Add sample SharePoint content.](@images/create/add-sp-content.webp)
    </Diagram>

    <Callouts>
      1. Go to the <a href="https://adobe.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/HelixProjects/Shared%20Documents/sites/starter-content-commerce" target="_blank">starter-content-commerce</a> folder and select all its content.
      1. Select the **Copy to** button.
      1. Select your site from the left-side list (or select **More places...** if you don't see it listed).
      1. Open the site folder you created earlier.
      1. Select **Copy here** and wait for the content to copy.
      1. When finished, you can select the link in the notification message to quickly go to your folder.
      1. You should see all the ✳︎new sample content you copied. Proceed to the next step.
    </Callouts>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step>

### Connect code to content

Using the URL of your Google Drive or SharePoint folder, we'll link your GitHub repo to your storefront content. This link enables Edge Delivery to coordinate code changes from the repo to the content in your folders. **After selecting your Google Drive or SharePoint folder URL, all steps within your GitHub repo are the same.**

<Diagram caption="Replace the default boilerplate's folder URL with your content folder URL.">
  ![Replace the default boilerplate's folder URL with your content folder
  URL.](@images/create/connect-code-to-content.webp)
</Diagram>

<Callouts>
1. Open your Google Drive folder and copy the URL from the browser's address bar **OR** open your
   SharePoint folder and select the **Copy link** button.
1. Go to your GitHub repo and open the `fstab.yaml` file from the project root.
1. Edit the `fstab.yaml` file in place.
1. Replace the default `mountpoints` URL (which points to the boilerplate's SharePoint folder) with your Google
   Drive or SharePoint folder URL.
1. Select the **Commit changes...** button.
1. Commit the changes directly to `main`.

</Callouts>

</Step>

<Step>

### Set up Sidekick

The Sidekick extension makes it easy for creators to connect, edit, preview, and publish content directly from documents and spreadsheets in Google Drive and SharePoint. Let's use the Sidekick Configurator to install Sidekick and configure it for our storefront.

<Diagram caption="Set up Sidekick.">
  ![Set up Sidekick.](@images/create/setup-sidekick.webp)
</Diagram>

<Callouts>

1. Open your GitHub repo and copy it's URL from the browser's address bar.
1. Open the [Sidekick Configurator](https://www.aem.live/tools/sidekick/) tool.
1. (_Required_) Paste your repo's URL into the **Repository URL** required\* field.
1. (_Optional_) Add a name that identifies your storefront.
1. Select the **Go** button. If you don't already have Sidekick installed, you should see links to install Sidekick or add the bookmarklet.
1. Install Sidekick from the Chrome Web Store or use the bookmarklet. If you're using the bookmarklet, drag it to your browser's bookmarks bar. If installing the extension, Pin the Sidekick extension to your browser's toolbar.
1. Return to the [Sidekick Configurator](https://www.aem.live/tools/sidekick/). You should now see a message stating "Your Sidekick is not configured for this project yet" and an **Add project** button.
1. Select the **Add project** button to complete your Sidekick setup. You should see a message stating: "Your Sidekick is configured for this project." You can now close the Sidekick Configurator.

</Step>

<Step>
### Set up your local development environment

1. Go to your GitHub repo and select the **Code** button to copy the repo's git URL for cloning (HTTPS or SSH).
1. Clone your repo from the terminal, replacing `URL` with the URL you just copied.

   ```bash frame="none"
   git clone URL
   ```

1. Navigate to the root of your local storefront project and install the dependencies.

   ```bash frame="none"
   npm install
   ```

1. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
1. Start the development server to view the boilerplate storefront.

   ```bash frame="none"
   npm start
   ```

   The first page of your boilerplate storefront should be visible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

   <Screenshot src={BoilerplateHomePage} alt="Boilerplate Home Page" width="740px" />

</Step>
</Steps>

## Run a LightHouse audit

1. Navigate to the PageSpeed Insights page: https://pagespeed.web.dev/.
1. Enter your `.live` storefront URL. The URLs for your preview and live sites take the following forms:

   - **Preview**: `https://main--{repo}--{owner}.hlx.page/`
   - **Live**: `https://main--{repo}--{owner}.hlx.live/`

1. Click the **Analyze** button to run the audit.
1. You should see full Web Vital reports for both mobile and desktop, with lighthouse scores at or very near 100 across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. 🚀

## Next steps

If you completed all the previous steps, congrats! You now have a Commerce storefront project on GitHub and a local development environment that you can use to learn how dropin components work and how you can customize them to develop your boilerplate into a production storefront.
