<Aside type="choose" title="**Choose One">
  Choose between **Google Drive** and **SharePoint OneDrive**. By default, the Commerce boilerplate
  uses SharePoint, but you can use Google Drive if you prefer. This tutorial provides instructions
  for both.
</Aside>

## Big picture

In this tutorial, you'll create an Edge Delivery Services + Commerce storefront from repo to render, as follows:

<Diagram caption="Broad steps to create your Commerce storefront.">
  ![Broad steps to create your Commerce storefront
  storefront.](@images/create/SimpleStorefrontSteps1.svg)
</Diagram>

The details are only slightly more involved. Let's break it down.

<Diagram caption="Details to create and configure your Commerce storefront.">
  ![Details to create and configure your Commerce
  storefront.](@images/create/DetailedStorefrontSteps.svg)
</Diagram>

<Callouts>

1. **Use the boilerplate** template to create a storefront repository.
1. **Add the Code Sync app** to your newly created repo. This app automatically redeploys your storefront when you push changes to the main branch. It also provides the Edge Delivery system (Helix Admin) with access to your repo so it can coordinate code changes with content changes.
1. **Create a folder** on Google Drive or SharePoint for your content and _Share_ it with the `helix@adobe.com` user. This gives the Edge Delivery system (Helix Admin) with read/write access to your folder's content.
1. **Add sample content** from the boilerplate to your new folder on Google Drive or SharePoint.
1. **Connect your repo to your content** using the mountpoint in your **fstab.yaml** URL in your GitHub repo.
1. **Install and configure Sidekick** so it can preview, publish, and edit content on your storefront.
1. **Set up your local development environment** and install the dependencies. Start the development server and explore your new storefront.

</Callouts>

Now that you know what you'll be doing, let's do it step-by-step.

## Step-by-step

The star of this **20-minute storefront** is our Commerce boilerplate template. It provides a fully-functional storefront that is pre-configured with our Commerce components and services and pre-connected to our Commerce boilerplate backend. Start your timers. Let's go!

<Tasks>

<Task>

### Create your storefront repo (~2 minutes)

This task requires you to have a GitHub account with access to the organization or owner where you want to create your new repo.

<Diagram caption="Create your storefront repo.">
  ![Create your storefront repo](@images/create/create-repo.webp)
</Diagram>

<Callouts columnCount="1">

1. Navigate to <Link href="https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce" text="aem-boilerplate-commerce" />, select the **Use this template** button, then select the **Create a new repository** option to open the form.
1. Complete the form with the following details:

   - **Repository template**: `hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce` (default).
   - **Include all branches**: Do not include all branches (default).
   - **Owner**: Your organization or account (required).
   - **Repository name**: A unique name for your new repo (required).
   - **Description**: A brief description of your repo (optional).
   - **Public or Private**: We recommend public (default).

1. Select the **Create repository** button and watch GitHub create your new storefront repo.
1. After a few seconds, you should be redirected to the home page of your new repo.

</Callouts>

</Task>

<Task>

### Add the Code Sync app (~3 minutes)

The Code Sync app redeploys your storefront site whenever you push or merge changes to the `main` branch of your repo. As described on the app's home page, Code Sync listens to changes in your code repositories, publishes code to the Edge Delivery code bus, and intelligently purges CDN caches when changes have been made. We'll add the app to your new repo now.

<Diagram caption="Add AEM Code Sync to your repository.">
  ![Add AEM Code Sync to your repository.](@images/create/code-sync.webp)
</Diagram>

<Aside type="note" title="Slightly different UIs">
  A gray background on an organization or account indicates that at least one repository within it
  has the Code Sync app installed. In such cases, you are redirected to your organization's or
  account's **Code Sync configuration page**. There are no differences in the steps, but the UI
  differs slightly from the one shown in the diagram (**Install** vs **Save** buttons), which shows
  the Code Sync page for new installations.
</Aside>

<Callouts>

1. Navigate to the <Link text="AEM Code Sync app" href="https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync" /> and select the **Configure** button (top right) to open the repo selection page.
1. Select the **organization** or **account** for the repo you just created.
1. From the form, choose **Only select repositories**, open the **Select repositories** selector, and choose your repo from the list.
1. Select **Install** (or **Save**, see note above) to complete the Code Sync installation.
1. You should see a **success screen** if the installation completed without errors. Your repo is now connected to the Edge Delivery Services code bus.
1. (_Optional_) If you return to the <Link text="account selection page" href="https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync/installations/select_target" />, your repo's organization or account will now be gray with "Configure" added. Select your org or account again to access the **Code Sync configuration page**. This page shows when the app was added to your organization (highlighted) and allows you to connect the Code Sync app to additional repositories.

</Callouts>

</Task>

<Task>

### Create and share content folder (~4 minutes)

Now let's create and set up the content side of your storefront. We'll create a new folder and share it with Edge Delivery Services. Choose the tab below that matches your chosen storage service, Google Drive or SharePoint.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Google Drive">

    Follow these steps to create and share your **Google Drive folder**.

    <Diagram caption="Create and Share your Google Drive folder.">
      ![Create and Share your Google Drive content folder.](@images/create/add-share-gd-folder.webp)
    </Diagram>

    <Callouts>

      1. Open your Google Drive <Link text="My Drive" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive" /> page, select the ✚ **New** button (top-left), create a new folder, and give it a name that identifies your storefront.
      1. Open your new folder (double-click).
      1. Open your folder's menu, and select the **Share > Share** menu item.
      1. Type **helix** and select `helix@adobe.com` as the recipient.
      1. Ensure the **Editor** option (default) is selected to give read/write access, then select the **Send** button.
      1. You can verify your folder is now shared if you see a new **Shared icon** (👥) to the right of your folder.
      1. Additionally, you can select the icon and verify that `helix@adobe.com` is listed as an **Editor**. If it is, your content folder is now connected to the Edge Delivery Services content bus.

    </Callouts>

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="SharePoint">

    Follow these steps to create and share your **SharePoint folder**.

    <Aside type="note" title="Site templates don't matter">
      During the process of creating your storefront folder on SharePoint, you must first setup a SharePoint Site. We don't use SharePoint Sites in Edge Delivery storefronts, so in step 3 below, you can select any template you want. It won't affect your storefront. We just need to create our folder in a site's **Documents** section.
    </Aside>

    <Diagram caption="Create and Share your SharePoint folder.">
      ![Create and Share your SharePoint Site folder.](@images/create/add-share-sp-folder.webp)
    </Diagram>

    <Callouts>

    1. Open your [SharePoint Home](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Home.aspx) page, select the ![create button](@images/create/create-button.svg) **Create** button, then select **Site** from the menu.
    1. Select the **Communication site**. You can choose the **Team site** if you prefer, but it's harder to set up.
    1. Select a site template, **Standard communication** is the simplest, then select **Use template**. Follow the additional instructions: Give your site a name, click **Next**, sensitivity is always private, default language is English, select **Create site**. When the site is created, you will be redirected to the Home page of your site.
    1. Select the **Documents** tab from your Home page.
    1. Create a new folder and give it a name that identifies your storefront.
    1. Open the folder and select the **Share** button.
    1. Type **helix** and select **AEM Content Integration** from the list.
    1. Select **Can edit** to provide read/write access to your folder.
    1. **Send** the invitation to give Edge Delivery Services (Helix Admin) read/write access to your folder. Your content folder is now connected to the Edge Delivery Services system.

    </Callouts>

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

By sharing read/write access to `helix@adobe.com`, you are enabling Edge Delivery Services to provide all the features of document-based authoring, such as editing, previewing, and publishing from Google Drive or SharePoint.

</Task>

<Task>

### Add sample content (~3 minutes)

Now let's add the boilerplate sample files to your content folder. Choose the tab below that matches your chosen storage service, Google Drive or SharePoint.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Google Drive">
    <Aside type="tip" title="Google Drive auto-conversions">
      The "secret" to converting Word and Excel sample files to Google Docs and Sheets is to enable Uploads in Google Drive's settings. Here's how.
    </Aside>

    <Diagram caption="Add sample Google Drive content.">
      ![Add sample Google Drive content.](@images/create/add-share-gd-folder.webp)
    </Diagram>

    <Callouts>
    1. Open the Google Drive folder you created in the previous task.
    1. Select the ⚙️ **Settings icon** (top-right of the page) and choose **Settings** from the menu.
    1. Enable the **Uploads** checkbox to convert uploads to Google Docs editor format. Return to your storefront folder.
    1. Go to the boilerplate's [Starter Content](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/releases/tag/starter-content) page and download the `starter-content-commerce.zip` file.
    1. Unzip the file and drag the contents into your folder. This will convert the Word and Excel files to Google Docs and Sheets. You now have some sample storefront content to play with.
    </Callouts>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="SharePoint">

    <Aside title="SharePoint content">
      With SharePoint, you can either copy the boilerplate files and folders from the <a href="https://adobe.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/HelixProjects/Shared%20Documents/sites/starter-content-commerce" target="_blank">starter-content-commerce</a> folder or download the [starter-content-commerce.zip](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce/releases/download/starter-content/starter-content-commerce.zip) from the boilerplate repo and drag the content into your folder. Both content sources are the same, so the choice is yours. But we'll show you how to copy the content from the SharePoint `starter-content-commerce` folder.
    </Aside>

    <Diagram caption="Add sample SharePoint content.">
      ![Add sample SharePoint content.](@images/create/add-sp-content.webp)
    </Diagram>

    <Callouts>
      1. Go to the <a href="https://adobe.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/HelixProjects/Shared%20Documents/sites/starter-content-commerce" target="_blank">starter-content-commerce</a> folder and select all its content.
      1. Select the **Copy to** button.
      1. Select your site from the left-side list (or select **More places...** if you don't see it listed).
      1. Open the site folder you created earlier.
      1. Select **Copy here** and wait for the content to copy.
      1. When finished, you can select the link in the notification message to quickly go to your folder.
      1. You should see all the ✳︎new sample content you copied. You now have some sample storefront content to play with.
    </Callouts>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

</Task>

<Task>

### Connect code to content (~3 minutes)

Now we need to link your GitHub storefront repo (the code) to your storefront folder (the content). Linking your code to your content enables Edge Delivery to coordinate code changes in the repo with content changes in your Google Drive or SharePoint folder. After step 1 below, all steps are the same for Google Drive and SharePoint.

<Diagram caption="Replace the default boilerplate's folder URL with your content folder URL.">
  ![Replace the default boilerplate's folder URL with your content folder
  URL.](@images/create/connect-code-to-content.webp)
</Diagram>

<Callouts>
1. Copy the URL to your content folder:

    - **For Google Drive**: Open your folder and copy the URL from the browser's address bar.
    - **For SharePoint**: Open your folder and select the **Copy link** button.

1. Go to your GitHub repo and open the `fstab.yaml` file from the project root.
1. Edit the `fstab.yaml` file in place.
1. Replace the default `mountpoints` URL (which points to the boilerplate's SharePoint folder) with your Google
   Drive or SharePoint folder URL.
1. Select the **Commit changes...** button.
1. Commit the changes directly to `main`. Now the Edge Delivery system knows where to find the content for this repository.

</Callouts>

</Task>

<Task>

### Set up Sidekick (~3 minutes)

The Sidekick extension makes it easy for creators to connect, edit, preview, and publish content directly from documents and spreadsheets in Google Drive and SharePoint. It's also responsible for pushing content to the Edge Delivery content bus so it can be previewed and published. For this task, we'll use the **Sidekick Configurator** to install Sidekick and configure it for our storefront.

<Diagram caption="Set up Sidekick.">
  ![Set up Sidekick.](@images/create/setup-sidekick.webp)
</Diagram>

<Callouts>

1. Open your **GitHub repo** and copy it's URL from the browser's address bar.
1. Open the [Sidekick Configurator](https://www.aem.live/tools/sidekick/) tool and complete the fields as follows:

   - **Repository URL**: Paste the URL to your repo (required).
   - **Project Name**: Add name that identifies your storefront (optional).

1. Select the **Go** button. If you don't already have Sidekick installed, you should see links to install Sidekick or add the bookmarklet.
1. Install Sidekick from the Chrome Web Store or use the bookmarklet. If you're using the bookmarklet, drag it to your browser's bookmarks bar. If installing the extension, Pin the Sidekick extension to your browser's toolbar.
1. Select the browser's back button to return to the Sidekick Configurator page. You should now see a message stating "Your Sidekick is not configured for this project yet" and an **Add project** button.
1. Select the **Add project** button to complete your Sidekick setup. You should see a message stating: "Your Sidekick is configured for this project."
1. Return to your folder, (a) select the `index` file, (b) select the **Sidekick** extension, (c) select the **Preview** button to render the `index` page in the browser, which also adds the content in your folder to the Edge Delivery content bus and internal CDN, where it can be downloaded and displayed on your browser for local development.

</Callouts>

:::note[Step 7 Details]
**Step 7 is only required for initial Sidekick and content set up**. Without previewing at least one file from your folder, the Edge Delivery CDN remains empty, causing **404 errors** when you try to run your storefront from your local development environment (our final task).
:::

You can now use Sidekick to **Preview**, **Publish**, and **Edit** files directly from your Google Drive or SharePoint folder. Take a moment to select any file in your folder, select the Sidekick extension, and choose the Sidekick options to get familiar with how Sidekick works. Visit the [Sidekick documentation](https://www.aem.live/docs/sidekick) for more information on how to use Sidekick to manage your storefront content.

</Task>

<Task>

### Set up your local development environment (~2 minutes)

1. Go to your GitHub repo and select the **Code** button to copy the repo's git URL for cloning (HTTPS or SSH).
1. Clone your repo from the terminal, replacing `URL` with the URL you just copied.

   ```bash frame="none"
   git clone URL
   ```

1. Navigate to the root of your local storefront project and install the dependencies.

   ```bash frame="none"
   npm install
   ```

1. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
1. Start the development server to view the boilerplate storefront.

   ```bash frame="none"
   npm start
   ```

   The first page of your boilerplate storefront should be visible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
