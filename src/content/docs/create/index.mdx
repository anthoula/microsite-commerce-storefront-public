Welcome! If you have 20 minutes, we can help you create one of the fastest storefronts on the web. Ready?

## Big picture

From repo to render, this tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a new Edge Delivery Services storefront using our Commerce boilerplate template and starter content. The process involves the following steps:

  ![Steps for creating your Edge Delivery Services storefront](@assets/create/storefront-setup.svg)
</Diagram>

<Callouts>

1. Use the boilerplate template to create your storefront repo.
1. Add the Code Sync GitHub app to your newly created repo. This app automatically redeploys the code whenever you push changes to the main branch of your storefront repo.
1. Create a new folder on Google Drive or SharePoint and share it (via email) with the Code Sync app. This folder is where you will add all your document-based authoring content.
1. Add the Sidekick Chrome extension and configure it to preview and publish your storefront.
1. Start the development server and explore the boilerplate storefront.

## Step-by-step

The quickest way to create a new storefront starts with our [Edge Delivery Services boilerplate](https://github.com/hlxsites/boilerplate-commerce-dropins). This section shows you how to use the boilerplate to create your own Commerce storefront. The boilerplate template is pre-configured with all of our Commerce components and services to give you a fully-functional storefront out-of-the-box. Let's get started.

<Tutorial>

### Create your storefront repo

1. Navigate to [aem-boilerplate-commerce](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce).
1. Select the **Use this template** button and select **Create a new repository**.
   :::note[Why use the template button?]
   When you use the template button (instead of directly cloning the boilerplate), GitHub copies all the content from the boilerplate repo (files and folders), but none of the commit history, remote links, or other version-control files. This ensures that your new storefront repository starts with a clean slate, ready for new development.
   :::
1. Choose the GitHub organization (or owner) and create the repository name.
1. Add a description and choose a visibility (we recommend public).
1. Select the **Create repository** button and watch GitHub create your new repo.

### Add the Code Sync GitHub app

1. Navigate to the [AEM Code Sync app](https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync) and click the **Configure** button.
1. Select the organization account to add the app to.
1. From GitHub's AEM Code Sync page, in the **Repository access** section, select the repository you created and click the **Save** button.
1. If the installation was successful, you'll be redirected to a success screen on https://aem.live. You can close the browser tab and proceed.

### Add your content source

:::note[Choose One!]
You can choose **Google Drive** or **SharePoint OneDrive** to store content for your Edge Delivery Services
storefront. But the boilerplate uses SharePoint OneDrive for the storefront content, so make sure you have an SharePoint account.

  rightIcon="external"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  aria-label="Link (opens in a new tab)"
/>

1. Create a new folder on Google Drive or SharePoint.
1. Share the folder with the Code Sync app by adding the app's email address as a collaborator.
1. Add your content to the shared folder. The app will automatically sync the content to your storefront.

### Set up your local development environment

1. Select the **Code** button and copy the repo's URL (HTTPS or SSH).
1. Clone your repo from the terminal, replacing `URL` with the URL you just copied.
   ```bash frame="none"
   git clone URL
   ```
1. Navigate to the root of your local storefront project and install the dependencies.
   ```bash frame="none"
   npm install
   ```
1. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
1. Start the development server to view the boilerplate storefront.
   ```bash frame="none"
   npm start
   ```
   The first page of your boilerplate storefront should be visible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Add the Sidekick extension

  rightIcon="external"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  aria-label="Link (opens in a new tab)"
/>

1. Install the Sidekick Chrome extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aem-sidekick/ccfggkjabjahcjoljmgmklhpaccedipo).
1. Open the Sidekick extension and configure it to preview and publish your storefront.

### Explore your new storefront!

The table below shows how each **boilerplate page** has a corresponding **Commerce block** which wraps the **dropin** (or widget) that provides the block with its features and functions.

:::note[Live Search components]
The Gear page is rendered by the [Live Search Product Listing Page
(PLP)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/live-search-storefront/plp-styling.html?lang=en)
and the Search box (üîç) is rendered by the [Live Search
Popover](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/live-search-storefront/storefront-popover.html?lang=en).
