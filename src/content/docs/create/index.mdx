Welcome! If you have 20 minutes, we can help you create one of the fastest storefronts on the web. Ready? Let's do this.

## Prerequisites

Before you start the clock, take a moment to ensure you have these tools and one of the accounts set up. If you don't have them yet, follow the links to create them.

<Aside type="choose" title="**Choose One">
  Choose between **Google Drive** and **SharePoint OneDrive**. By default, the Commerce boilerplate
  uses SharePoint, but you can use Google Drive if you prefer. This tutorial provides instructions
  for both.

## Big picture

From repo to render, this tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a new Edge Delivery Services storefront using our Commerce boilerplate template and starter content. The process involves the following steps:

<Diagram caption="Steps to create your Edge Delivery Services storefront.">
  ![Steps to create your Edge Delivery Services storefront](@assets/create/createStorefront.svg)
</Diagram>

<Callouts>

1. **Use the boilerplate** template to create a storefront repository.
1. **Add the Code Sync app** to your newly created repo. This app automatically redeploys your storefront when you push changes to the main branch. It also provides the Edge Delivery system (Helix Admin) with access to your repo so it can coordinate code changes with content changes.
1. **Create a folder** on Google Drive or SharePoint for your content and _Share_ it with the `helix@adobe.com` user. This gives the Edge Delivery system (Helix Admin) with read/write access to your folder's content.
1. **Add sample content** from the boilerplate to your new folder on Google Drive or SharePoint.
1. **Connect your repo to your content** using the mountpoint in your **fstab.yaml** URL in your GitHub repo.
1. **Install and configure Sidekick** so it can preview, publish, and edit content on your storefront.
1. **Set up your local development environment** and install the dependencies. Start the development server and explore your new storefront.

</Callouts>

## Step-by-step

The star of this 20-minute storefront is our Commerce boilerplate template. It provides a fully-functional storefront that is pre-configured with our Commerce components and services and pre-connected to our Commerce boilerplate backend. Start your timers. Let's go!

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create your storefront repo

1. Navigate to [aem-boilerplate-commerce](https://github.com/hlxsites/aem-boilerplate-commerce).
1. Select the **Use this template** button and select **Create a new repository**.

   <Aside type="github" title="Why use the template button?">
     When you use the template button (instead of directly cloning the boilerplate), GitHub copies
     all the content from the boilerplate repo (files and folders), but none of the commit history,
     remote links, or other version-control files. This ensures that your new storefront repository
     starts with a clean slate, ready for new development.
   </Aside>

1. Choose your GitHub organization (or owner) and create the repository name.
1. Add a repo description and choose a visibility of public or private (we recommend public).
1. Select the **Create repository** button and watch GitHub create your new repo.

</Step>

<Step>

### Add the Code Sync app

When added to your repo, this app redeploys your storefront site whenever you push or merge changes to the `main` branch of your storefront. The app keeps your storefront up-to-date with your code changes. And it provides the Edge Delivery infrastructure (Helix Admin) with access to your repo so that it can coordinate code changes with the content changes from Google Drive or SharePoint. More details later. Let's add the app now.

1. Navigate to the [AEM Code Sync app](https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync) and select the **Configure** button at the top right.
1. Select the organization or owner for where you added your new repo.
1. Find the **Repository access** section and choose **Only select repositories**, then select your repo from the menu, and click **Save**.

   <Diagram caption="Add AEM Code Sync to your repository.">
     ![Add AEM Code Sync to your repository.](@assets/create/repository-access.png)
   </Diagram>

1. You'll get a success screen if the installation completed without errors. Close the page and proceed.

</Step>

<Step>

### Create your content folder

Now let's create and set up the content side of your storefront. We'll create a shared folder in Google Drive and add some sample content.

1. Go to the **Google Drive** üè† **Home** page and create a new folder for your storefront content using the ‚úö **New** button at the top-left.

1. Open your new folder and share it with `helix@adobe.com` as shown here:

   <Diagram width="494px" caption="Share your content folder.">

   ![Share your content folder.](@assets/create/share-menu.webp)

   ![Share your content folder.](@assets/create/share-screen.webp)

   </Diagram>

   This provides the Edge Delivery infrastructure (Helix Admin) with read/write access to your folder's content so it can provide all the features of document-based authoring, such as editing, previewing, and publishing from Google Drive or SharePoint. So our next step is to add the boilerplate sample content to this folder.

</Step>

<Step>
### Add sample content

1. Download the and unzip it to your local computer.
1. Drag the unzipped folder into your shared Google Drive folder.
1. Open the `content` folder and click on the `index.md` file to view the content in Google Drive.

:::note[Content structure]
The file structure in Google Drive becomes your website structure.
:::

</Step>

<Step>
### Connect the Code to the Content

In this step, we'll connect the code in your GitHub repo to the content in your Google Drive folder. This connection allows Edge Delivery to coordinate code changes with content changes, so your storefront stays up-to-date with all the latest changes from both sides (code and content).

1. Copy the **Content URL** from the Google Drive folder.
1. Go to your GitHub repo and open the `fstab.yaml` file.
1. Replace the `content` URL with the URL you copied from Google Drive.

   ```yaml
   mountpoints:
   /: https://adobe.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/HelixProjects/Shared%20Documents/sites/starter-content-commerce
   ```

1. Commit the changes to your repo.

   ```bash frame="none"
    git add fstab.yaml
    git commit -m "Add Google Drive content URL"
    git push origin main
   ```

</Step>

<Step>

### Add the Sidekick extension

The Sidekick Chrome extension adds a convenient UI to the browser that makes it easy for content creators to connect, edit, preview, and publish new content to the storefront from documents and spreadsheets in Google Drive or SharePoint. Let's install it now to see how it works.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard

    rightIcon="external"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    aria-label="Link (opens in a new tab)"
  />
</CardGrid>

1. Install the Sidekick Chrome extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aem-sidekick/ccfggkjabjahcjoljmgmklhpaccedipo).
1. Open the Sidekick extension and configure it to preview and publish your storefront.

</Step>

<Step>
### Set up your local development environment

1. Select the **Code** button and copy the repo's URL (HTTPS or SSH).
1. Clone your repo from the terminal, replacing `URL` with the URL you just copied.

   ```bash frame="none"
   git clone URL
   ```

1. Navigate to the root of your local storefront project and install the dependencies.

   ```bash frame="none"
   npm install
   ```

1. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
1. Start the development server to view the boilerplate storefront.

   ```bash frame="none"
   npm start
   ```

   The first page of your boilerplate storefront should be visible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>

<Step>

### Run a LightHouse audit

1. Navigate to https://pagespeed.web.dev/ and enter your storefront URL.
1. Click the **Analyze** button to run the audit.
1. Look at those initial scores! üöÄ

</Step>

</Steps>

## Next steps

If you completed all the previous steps, congrats! You now have a Commerce storefront project on GitHub and a local development environment that you can use to learn how dropin components work and how you can customize them to develop your boilerplate into a production storefront.
