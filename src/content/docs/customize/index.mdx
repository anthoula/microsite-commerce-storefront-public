All dropins can be customized in five ways: design tokens, CSS classes, slots, content enrichment, and localization. In this section, you'll learn how to use each approach.

## Design tokens

Design tokens is the quickest way to customize your storefront. The goal of branding is to replace the storefront design token values with the values of your brand's colors, typography, spacing, and shapes.

## CSS classes

CSS classes your storefront goes deeper than branding, which only overrides CSS token values. But styling overrides CSS classes or adds new classes. You'll find best-practices for styling here.

## Slots

Slots provide the deepest level of customization. Slots are built-in extension points in the dropin to add your own UI components and functions. You'll learn just how powerful slots can be.

## Content enrichment

Content enrichment is similar to adding content with slots. The difference is in scale. Enrichment is an Edge Delivery feature that provides a way to add content to entire product categories.

## Localization

Localization is one of the easiest ways to customize your dropins to a region. This page shows how to add a second language file and use it in your dropins.
