Customizing dropins involves modifying the default behavior, appearance, and functionality of dropins to better suit your specific needs. This can range from simple changes like branding to deeper customizations like extending and enriching dropins. Let's explore these customization levels in more detail.

## Brand Dropins

[Branding](src/content/docs/customize/brand.mdx) is the quickest way to customize your storefront. The goal of branding is to replace the storefront design token values with the values of your brand's colors, typography, spacing, and shapes.

## Style Dropins

[Styling](src/content/docs/customize/style.mdx) your storefront goes deeper than branding, which only overrides CSS token values. But styling overrides CSS classes or adds new classes. You'll find best-practices for styling here.

## Localize Dropins

In our global economy, [localization](src/content/docs/customize/localize.mdx) is crucial. And it's one of the easiest changes to make. This page shows how to add a second language file and use it in your storefront.

## Extend Dropins

[Extending dropins](src/content/docs/customize/extend.mdx) is the deepest level of customization. Dropins provide built-in extension points called slots. A slot provides a place in the dropin to add your own UI components and functions.

## Enrich Dropins

[Enriching dropins](src/content/docs/customize/enrich.mdx) is similar to adding content with slots. The difference is in scale. Enrichment is an Edge Delivery feature that provides a way to add content to entire product categories.
