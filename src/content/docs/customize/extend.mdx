Learn how to extend dropins using slots.

## Concepts

<Concepts>

### Container

Component that manage or encapsulate other components. Containers handle logic, fetch data, manage state, and pass data to the UI components that are rendered on the screen.

### Slot

Component that provide placeholders to inject other components. Slots are used to extend the functionality of a component by allowing you to inject other components into it.

### Component

Overloaded term in web development. Everything is a component. It's components all the way down. This is why we need to be specific about what kind of component we are talking about. For example, from top-to-bottom, big-to-small, a **dropin component** can contain multiple **container components** that can contain multiple **slot components** that can contain multiple **UI components**.
