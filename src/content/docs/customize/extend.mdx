import Concepts from '@components/Concepts.astro';

Extending dropins is the deepest level of customization. Dropins provide built-in extension points, called slots. A slot provides a place in the dropin to add your own UI components and functions. This architecture makes it easy to change the default look, layout, and behavior. Let's learn how it works.

## Concepts

<Concepts>

### Container

Component that manages or encapsulates other components. Containers handle logic, fetch data, manage state, and pass data to the UI components that are rendered on the screen.

### Slot

Component that provides placeholders to add other components. You can use a dropin's built-in Slots to add or remove UI components and functions. or you can add your own additional Slots. 

### Component

Overloaded term in web development. Everything is a component. It's components all the way down. This is why we need to be specific about what kind of component we are talking about. For example, from top-to-bottom, big-to-small, a **dropin component** can contain multiple **container components** that can contain multiple **slot components** that can contain multiple **UI components**.
