Branding is the first and quickest level of customizing your storefront. In this section, you'll override the **Commerce design-token values** to match your brand colors, typography, spacing, shapes, and layouts. Let's dive in.

## Concepts

<Concepts>

### design tokens

CSS variables with default values. Our design tokens provide a standard set of CSS properties and default values for colors, typography, spacing, shapes, and layouts. We use them in all of our component CSS classes to avoid hard-coded values that cannot be easily changed. With this strategy, you can restyle our dropins to match your brand simply by changing the default token values.

<CodeImport code={base} title="All default design tokens" lang="css" frame="none" />

### library components

Basic components (like `Button`, `Checkbox`, and `Carousel`) used to build dropins. Design tokens are embedded in the CSS classes of these components to ensure fast, flexible styling to match your brand.

### Adobe Commerce design system

The collection of design tokens, library components, and conventions we use to style our dropins.

### brand

To override the built-in design token default values to match your brand's colors, typography, spacing, shapes, and layouts.

### style

To change existing dropin CSS classes or add new CSS classes to the dropin elements. Styling provides a deeper level of customization than branding.

## Diagrams

The following diagram shows a small branding change. When we override the default value of a single shape token, we override the default border-radius of the `Button` library component, which changes the look and feel of dropins that use it.

## Examples

This example shows six design tokens with new values for three color and three shape tokens from the boilerplate's `./assets/brand/styles.css` file.

<Code code={styles} lang="css" title="./assets/brand/styles.css" />

## Step-by-step

Include explicit steps for those who are doing this for the first time.
