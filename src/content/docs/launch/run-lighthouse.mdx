For the most accurate Lighthouse audits during development, make sure you are adding your storefront's `.live` URL in the text field on PageSpeed Insights. This will ensure that the audit is run against your production storefront.

## PageSpeed Insights

PageSpeed Insights is the most accurate way to audit your storefront's Web Vitals. It uses the same Lighthouse engine as the Chrome DevTools, but it runs the audit on a real device in a controlled environment. This is important because the performance of your storefront can vary depending on the device and network conditions.
