title: Find Your Storefront
description: Learn where your Commerce Journey begins and how to use the documentation.
---

This page will provide the narrative, organization, and scope of this site to explain how **Adobe Commerce** + **Edge Delivery Services** + **Dropins** + **AEM content authoring** work together to offer customers multiple paths to an Adobe Commerce Storefront that meets them where they are and takes them where they want to go.

## Find your storefront

I'd eventually like to include a flowchart with three starting points that describe three common scenarios a customer might currently identify with. Moving through the flow chart (yes/no) will take them to the combinations of services/components that leads them to the Adobe Commerce Storefront that's right for them. _That's why Storefronts is plural in this doc site's name._

## Site framing

This site frames everything in terms of "the storefront" because that's the where customers are, that's what they're thinking about, and that's what developers are hired to build, meaning that framing the site at the storefront level benefits everyone. But that doesn't mean there is any less focus on the dropins and services that make up the storefront. Dropins will always be the central content of the site.

## Things to include here

- **Adobe Commerce backend/service requirements**. Some brief overview docs but with links to the details in existing documentation. _Problem here is that existing documentation is not available._

- **Dropin components**. Will include overview docs about the central role of dropins as the Commerce components that define a our storefronts. Include discussions of how dropins are agnostic and can be used in any storefront framework (Vanilla, React, Vue, etc). This will be discussed in greater detail within dropin-anatomy and/or dropin-resources.

- **Edge Delivery Services**. Will include brief overview of EDS, links to more info, and identification of Edge Delivery/AEM boilerplate with dropin integrations.

- **AEM content authoring**. Will include brief overview of document-based authoring—in the context of the boilerplate with integrated dropins—with links to existing docs at https://aem.live.
