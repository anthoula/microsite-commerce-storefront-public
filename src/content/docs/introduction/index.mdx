## Concepts

### Edge Delivery Services

### Commerce dropins

Full-featured shopping components that turn websites into storefronts. They are not the primitive components, like the Carousels and Galleries used within them. For example, our Product Details, Checkout, and Cart dropins are featured as full pages out of the box to create the entire storefront shopping experience for a website. Our dropins can also support different layouts for different purposes. For example, our MiniCart is simply a Cart with compact layout typical of MiniCarts so that they can be added to Popover or Panel components.
