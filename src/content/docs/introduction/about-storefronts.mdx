This page should start by explaining the different ways customers can create an "Adobe Commerce Storefront" for their site. The page should introduce the concept of "Storefronts" as a plural noun, because there are multiple ways to create a storefront, and the right one for a customer depends on their unique needs and circumstances.

## What is an Adobe Commerce Storefront?

Explain the concept of an "Adobe Commerce Storefront" as defined by the collection of **dropin components** and **Commerce services** that work together to create a variety of great shopping experiences â€” on any platform!

Adobe Commerce Storefronts â€” defined by Commerce dropins and backend services â€” can take a variety of forms because dropins (and their required services) are built to work with any frontend:

<Steps>

1. **EDS Storefront** â€” For amazing speed and easy authoring.
1. **Vanilla Storefront** â€” Look, Ma, no frameworks!
1. **React Storefront** â€” No problem, we gotcha covered.
1. **Vue Storefront** â€” Again, no problem; whatever you got, we gotcha covered.

</Steps>

## This site's narrative

This site should frame its contents in the context of Adobe Commerce Storefronts. Storefronts are what customers are thinking about and what developers are hired to build. It think that validates framing this site at the higher **storefront level**. It's a good starting place for both merchants and developers.

But that doesn't mean there is any less focus on the **dropins** that define all Commerce storefronts.

**Dropins** are the **main characters in _this_ site's narrative** because the other documentation sites â€” [Experience League](https://experienceleague.corp.adobe.com/docs/commerce.html?lang=en) and [aem.live](https://www.aem.live/docs/) â€” already give screen time to Edge Delivery Services and AEM authoring, which I will link to for scene changes as needed.

## Things to include here

- **Adobe Commerce backend/service requirements**. Some brief overview docs but with links to the details in existing documentation. _Problem here is that existing documentation is not available._

- **Dropin components**. Will include overview docs about the central role of dropins as the Commerce components that define a our storefronts. Include discussions of how dropins are agnostic and can be used in any storefront framework (Vanilla, React, Vue, etc). This will be discussed in greater detail within dropin-anatomy and/or dropin-resources.

- **Edge Delivery Services**. Will include brief overview of EDS, links to more info, and identification of Edge Delivery/AEM boilerplate with dropin integrations.

- **AEM content authoring**. Will include brief overview of document-based authoringâ€”in the context of the boilerplate with integrated dropinsâ€”with links to existing docs at https://aem.live.
