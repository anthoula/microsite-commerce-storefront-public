Dropins are full-featured shopping components that turn websites into storefronts. Dropins are not primitive components, like Carousels and Galleries. They are composable components that define the storefront shopping experience such as Product Detail Pages, Shopping Carts, Checkout, and Payment Methods. We designed them to be fast, easy to use, and easy to customize.
