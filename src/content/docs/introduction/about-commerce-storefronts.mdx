Adobe Commerce Storefronts are defined by frontends that use Commerce dropin components (like Product Details, Cart, Checkout) and Commerce Services (like Catalog Service, Live Search, Product Recommendations). Our dropin components are designed to be among the fastest and most adaptable commerce components in the industry. 

## About this site

This site is dedicated to helping you understand and use our Commerce dropin components and services for whichever frontend framework best meets your needs.

You'll find detailed information about the purpose ([What are dropins?](/dropin-components/what-are-dropins/)) and structure ([Drop-in Anatomy](/dropin-components/dropin-anatomy/)) of our dropins. Then you'll work through a hands-on, in-depth tutorial that will teach you the essential dropin features and capabilities using our Edge Delivery Services storefront boilerplate.
