### Data Connection service

The Data Connection extension connects your Adobe Commerce storefront to the Adobe Experience Platform and the Edge Network so that you can enrich and personalize the shopping experience for your customers. Refer to the [Data Connection Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/data-connection/overview.html?lang=en) for details and installation instructions.

### Services Connector

The Services Connector connects your Commerce storefront to the Commerce backend services listed below. Refer to the [Commerce Services Connector Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/commerce-services-connector/guide-overview.html?lang=en) for details and installation instructions.

### Catalog Sync service

The Catalog Sync service synchronizes Commerce catalog data with your Commerce storefront. The service is continuously triggered by events that change your catalog data, like product price and inventory changes. Refer to the [Catalog Sync Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/catalog-sync/guide-overview.html?lang=en) for details and installation instructions.

### Catalog Service

The Catalog Service module provides fast read-only access to Commerce catalog data. The Product Details dropin requires this service to render product data in the storefront. Refer to the [Catalog Service Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/catalog-service/guide-overview.html?lang=en) for details and installation instructions.

### Live Search

The Live Search service replaces the default Commerce catalog search and installs the Product Listing Page (PLP) widget in your storefront. Refer to the [Live Search Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/guide-overview.html?lang=en) for details and installation instructions.

### Product Recommendations

Product Recommendations uses artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms ([Adobe Sensei](https://business.adobe.com/products/sensei/adobe-sensei.html)) to create personalized storefront experiences. While not a strict requirement, we recommended it for Commerce storefronts. Refer to the [Product Recommendations Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/product-recommendations/guide-overview.html?lang=en) for details and installation instructions.
