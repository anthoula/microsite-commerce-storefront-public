Dropins are Adobe Commerce components, like Product Details, Cart, and Checkout, that can be
dropped-into existing websites to quickly create fast and adaptable storefronts. 

## Dropins are the building blocks of our storefronts

Dropins components (along with Commerce services) make up the entire storefront experience. They are equivalent to small apps that you can mix and match to create a storefront that fits your needs.

## Framework Agnostic

Our dropin components easily integrate into the most popular frontend frameworks, or into no framework at all! Here are a few of them:

<Steps>
1. **React** — For when you want to use—or already use—the most popular frontend framework for your storefront.

1. **Vue** — For when you know and love Vue for its simplicity, flexibility and performance.

1. **Vanilla web** — For when HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all you want.

1. **Edge Delivery Services** — (highly recommended!) For when you need amazing speed from a performance-first architecture; built-in analytics; real user monitoring (RUM); parallel authoring, development, and design for fast development cycles; and a storefront boilerplate pre-configured with all our Commerce components and services. Popular? Not yet. Biased? Yes, and for good reason!
