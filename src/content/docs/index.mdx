## What are dropin components?

<Summary>
  Dropins are storefront components, like Product Details, Cart, and Checkout, that can be
  dropped-into existing sites to quickly create fast and adaptable storefronts. We built our dropins
  so that designers and writers can work alongside developers to get your storefronts into
  production as soon as possible.
