## What are drop-in components?

<Summary>
  Drop-ins are storefront components, like Product Details, Cart, and Checkout, that can be
  dropped-into existing sites to quickly create fast and adaptable storefronts. We built our
  drop-ins so that designers and writers can work alongside developers to get your storefronts into
  production as soon as possible.
