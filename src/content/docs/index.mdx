## What are drop-ins?

<Summary>
  Drop-ins are composable (modular, independent) Adobe Commerce components such as Carts,
  ProductDetails, and more. Drop-ins are built from the ground up to be fast and adaptable to your
  storefront brand and specific needs, with content that can be added and updated by non-technical
  team members.
