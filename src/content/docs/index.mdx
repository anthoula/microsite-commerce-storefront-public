## What are drop-ins?

<Summary>
  Drop-ins are composable (modular, independent) Adobe Commerce components such as Cart, Checkout,
  and ProductDetails. They are built from the ground up to be extremely fast and adaptable to your
  company's brand and specific needs. Best of all, designers and writers can work in parallel with
  developers to brand and enrich the drop-ins with styling and content that matches your brand.
