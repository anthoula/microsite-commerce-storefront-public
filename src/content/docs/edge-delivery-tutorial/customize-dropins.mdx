This is a huge topic that I'll be finishing this week. It's one of our key differentiators so I want to make sure it's well done.

## Concepts

Include concepts to understand first before getting to the details.

## Diagrams

Include diagrams to explain the key concepts and workflows.

## Examples

Include annotated code examples to get more concrete.

## Step-by-Step

Include explicit steps for beginners.

## Playground

Include an embedded sandbox ([Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs)) to provide hands-on practice for the concepts just learned.

<Aside type="note" title="Link to playground">
  Depending on the complexity of the topic, this section might need to add a button link to a
  project setup on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/) or
  [stackblitz.com](https://stackblitz.com/).
