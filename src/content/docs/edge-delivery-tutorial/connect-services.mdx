This section describes how a Commerce Edge Delivery storefront connects to a Commerce backend. This boilerplate is pre-configured to connect to the boilerplate backend so you can start learning immediately. But eventually, you'll need to update those connections for your own Commerce backend. When that time comes, you'll know what to do.

## Storefront configuration

The boilerplate connects to its Commerce backend using a **Microsoft Excel file** called `configs.xlsx`, located in the boilerplate's connected **SharePoint directory**. Navigate to that directory from the mountpoint link in the boilerplate's `fstab.yaml` file. You should see the `configs.xlsx` file at the root of the SharePoint directory. Open the file to view the connection **keys** and **values** to the boilerplate's backend. They should look similar to the following:

<OptionsTable
  options={[
    ['Key', 'Value'],
    ['commerce-endpoint', 'https://catalog-service-sandbox.adobe.io/graphql'],
    [
      'commerce-core-endpoint',
      'https://graph.adobe.io/api/a2975be6-bfb1-4be5-bb9b-b330fd46a6d8/graphql?api_key=a28717f2dc814395a2b536d527ef9ad5',
    ],
    ['commerce-environment-id', '3b0cc8f4-7dd3-4bcb-bb65-b9e11358a080'],
    ['commerce-root-category-id', '2'],
    ['commerce-website-code', 'base'],
    ['commerce-store-code', 'main_website_store'],
    ['commerce-store-view-code', 'default'],
    ['commerce-customer-group', 'b6589fc6ab0dc82cf12099d1c2d40ab994e8410c'],
    ['commerce-x-api-key', 'ba7fa6fca7a64922a533e8c28426aa44'],
  ]}
/>

## Backend keys and values

Below are brief descriptions of the configuration keys and values in the boilerplate's `configs.xlsx` file. The links should help you understand and add these settings to your Commerce backend.
