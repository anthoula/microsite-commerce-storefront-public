In this section, we'll describe how to connect a storefront to a Commerce backend.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to create categories, websites, stores, and store views.
- A clear plan for the structure of your categories and websites.

## Configure your Commerce backend

To connect your Commerce storefront to a Commerce backend, you need to configure the following settings in the Admin UI:

Create Root Categories:

Access the Admin panel and navigate to Catalog > Categories.
Select "Add Root Category" and provide a unique name.
Ensure "Enable Category" is set to Yes.
Save and repeat for each store.

Create Websites:

In the Admin, go to Stores > Settings > All Stores and click "Create Website".
Enter a name and a unique code for the website (e.g., "french").
Optionally set a numerical sort order.
Save and repeat as needed.
Create Stores:

Navigate to Stores > Settings > All Stores and click "Create Store".
Associate the store with a website and root category.
Provide a unique name and code for the store.
Save and repeat for additional stores.
Create Store Views:

Go to Stores > Settings > All Stores and select "Create Store View".
Associate the store view with a store and provide a unique name and code.
Ensure the status is set to Enabled.
Save and repeat as required.
Change the Website Base URL:

Access Stores > Settings > Configuration > General > Web.
Select the website and modify the Base URL and Base Link URL fields to the desired URL (e.g., http://french.magento.mg).
Adjust secure base URLs if necessary.
Save and repeat for each website.
Add Store Code to the Base URL:

In the Configuration section under General > Web, select "Default Config".
Expand Url Options and enable "Add Store Code to Urls".
Save the configuration.
Change the Default Store View Base URL:

This step ensures access to the Admin after setup. Adjust the Base URL for the default store view to your main site URL.
Save the configuration.
