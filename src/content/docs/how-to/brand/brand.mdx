This section teaches you how to override the drop-in design token values to match your brand's colors, typography, spacing, shapes, and layouts. But first, let's define the vocabulary and concepts required to understand this process.

## Concepts

**Design tokens**: CSS variables with default values. Our design tokens provide a standard set of CSS properties and default values for colors, typography, spacing, shapes, and layouts. We use them in all of our component CSS classes to avoid hard-coded values that cannot be easily changed. With this strategy, you can restyle our drop-ins to match your brand simply by changing the default token values.

**Library components**: Basic components like `Accordion`, `Button`, `Checkbox`, `Card`, `Carousel` used to build drop-ins. Design tokens are embedded in the CSS classes of these components to ensure fast, flexible styling to match your brand.

**Drop-in design system**: The collection of design tokens, library components, and style conventions we use to style our drop-ins.

**Branding**: The process of changing the design token default values to match your brand's colors, typography, spacing, shapes, and layouts.

## Diagrams

The diagram below shows the basic concept for overriding the default value of one design token â€” the shape (border-radius) applied to the default Button.
