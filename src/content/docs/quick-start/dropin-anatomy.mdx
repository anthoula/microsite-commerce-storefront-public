Dropins are storefront components, like Product Details, Cart, and Checkout, that can be
dropped-into existing sites to quickly create fast and adaptable storefronts. We built our dropins
so that designers and writers can work alongside developers to get your storefronts into
production as soon as possible.

- What are dropins? Why they matter; what problems they solve.

- How do they work? (data and execution flow diagrams)
- How do I use them? (general: introduce usage basics and link to the `using` page)
- How do I customize them? (general: mention base tokens, slots, etc. and link to the `customizing` page)
