import Steps from '@components/Steps.astro';

In this quick-start, we use the [Commerce boilerplate](https://github.com/hlxsites/boilerplate-commerce-dropins) to create a basic storefront that includes all our current drop-insâ€”ready for you to brand and customize.

**This is a test for embedded PDFs. It will be replaced with a different SVG graphic later. This is only a test.**

## Steps

After completing the following steps, you will have a local development environment where you can learn about the parts of a drop-in ([Drop-in Anatomy](/quick-start/dropin-anatomy/)) and the tools and resources available ([Drop-in Resources](/quick-start/dropin-resources/)) to complete the essential development tasks described in the **How To** section.

<Steps>

## Create your storefront repository

Navigate to [boilerplate-commerce-dropins](https://github.com/hlxsites/boilerplate-commerce-dropins).
Click the **Use this template** button and select **Create a new repository**.
Choose an owner and repository name. Optional: Choose a description and visibility, then click the **Create repository** button.

## Clone your storefront repository

Navigate to your new repository and click the **Code** button.
Copy the URL (HTTPS or SSH).
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone your storefront repository.
Run the following command, replacing `URL` with the URL you copied:

```bash frame="none"
git clone URL
```

## Install storefront dependencies

Navigate to your new storefront directory and run the following command:

```bash frame="none"
npm i
```

## Add the AEM Code Sync app to your repository

Navigate to the [AEM Code Sync app](https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync) and click the **Configure** button. Select the organization account to add the app to. From GitHub's AEM Code Sync page, in the **Repository access** section, select the repository you created and click the **Save** button. If the installation was successful, you'll be redirected to success screen on https//aem.live. You can close this tab.

## Start the development server

Run the following command:

```bash frame="none"
npm start
```

You should see the first page of your boilerplate storefront at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Look around your new storefront
