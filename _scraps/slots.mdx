We have all these "primitive" methods that apply to all Slots. It would be great to have a section (globally) that apply for all Slots that explain what slots are and all those methods. We can then link any documentations for Slots to this section, and just have to detail Slot Methods like appendButton in Actions

Yes. That’s actually the plan, I was thinking/planning this as I wrote it, but wanted to get it all down “somewhere” for review instead of breaking the flow to figure out the reorg. But, yes, that currently applies to a few parts of the docs right now. Will work out some organization fixes today.

Summary
The Product Details dropin provides slots for nearly every part of its UI, allowing you to customize every detail to create a unique and branded experience for your customers.
Seems like something you'd want at the top, not the bottom, of the page.

sort the slots in "Example customizations" by alphabetical order, perhaps?

consider adding some more robust docs for the Actions slot, and any other ones we anticipate to be used often.
