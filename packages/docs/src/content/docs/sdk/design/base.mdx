import { Card, LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import colors from '@sdk/assets/Colors.png';
import spacing from '@sdk/assets/Spacing.png';
import typography from '@sdk/assets/Typography.png';
import shapeStyles from '@sdk/assets/ShapeStyles.png';

With Base, you can use system and reference tokens to ensure color, typography, spacing, and shape values are consistent across your site.

## What are design tokens?

Design tokens are design decisions that ensure a unified and cohesive product experience. The tokens represent a consistent use of design data that provides specific values for spacing, color, typography, and shapesâ€”without hard-coding those values.

Our Base design tokens are directly integrated into our component libraries. They cover the various options for platforms, component states, and more.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Colors"
    href="/sdk/design/colors"
    description="Create meaningful experiences while also expressing hierarchy, state, and brand identity."
  ></LinkCard>
  <LinkCard
    title="Typography"
    href="/sdk/design/typography"
    description="Set your typography scale to present your content as clearly and efficiently as possible."
  ></LinkCard>
  <LinkCard
    title="Spacing"
    href="/sdk/design/spacing"
    description="Create harmonious arrangements with consistent visual balance and predictable rhythm."
  ></LinkCard>
  <LinkCard
    title="Shape styles"
    href="/sdk/design/shapes"
    description="Grab user attention by using shadows or other visual cues, such as strokes, border-radius, and size."
  ></LinkCard>
</CardGrid>

## Extending the baseline design tokens

Base includes a set of baseline design tokens and default values for you to
customize, collaborate on, and use in your own designs and product
implementation.

It's important to keep in mind that not every component is going to be
captured in the foundational and baseline design tokens. If they're limited
for what you're trying to design or build, just add in the tokens you may
need within each category.

## How to use design tokens

To apply design tokens on your project, make use of the UIProvider, which grants components access to the design tokens as CSS variables. Simply specify the desired design token using the var() CSS function to apply its corresponding value.

```css
.myComponent {
  background-color: var(--color-brand-500);
}
```
